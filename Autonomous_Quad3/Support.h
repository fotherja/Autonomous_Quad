// Finished yesturday with 2.0, 0, 0 but that was overshooting
// Sunday:
// 1.0,0,0.25 worked quite well but still overshot
// 0.8,0,0.4 and set limits from 150 to 200 - pretty much working. Need a fixed altitude!
// 1.0,0.01,0.6 - changed X set point to 25.0 to make quad fly inside line. (must fly clockwise I think) - SET LAP TIMES WITH THIS!!
// 1.0,0.01,0.8 - oscillitory.



// 1.0,0,0 - divergent oscillations
// 0.5,0,0 - same but slower
// 3.0 - massive oscilations
// 1.5, 0.0, 0.5 - trying to compensate for undamped roll/acc response
//
// increased yaw p from 5 to 7.5 - yaw oscillations
// yaw p back to 5.0 changed set point from 25 to -25
// yaw to p=5.0, setpoint -25 to 50 cause it doesn't seem to be doing anything (optim probs between 5-6)
// yaw added 0.5 to d, setpoint from 50 to 25 (correct for clockwise flight)
